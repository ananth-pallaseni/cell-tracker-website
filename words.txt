Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) are responsible for regenerating the supply of all types of blood cells required for healthy function via their ability to differentiate and self-renew. HSCs are found primarily in the red bone marrow, inside a highly specialised niche which regulates their function. [2, 3] The study of HSCs and the niche they occupy is of extreme importance in the understanding and treatment of hematological disease. A particular area that has seen little examination is the characterization of HSC morphology as they move about and interact in their environment. A look at the shape and location of HSCs would shed light on this poorly understood area. To this end, intravital microscopy has proven a very promising technique to enable viewing of HSCs in vivo, allowing unique perspectives on their interactions within the niche [4, 5]. However, processing of microscopy data can be very time consuming to do manually and although techniques exist to perform automatic segmentation of structures these suffer from being restricted to two dimensions [6] or from not taking into account the time variance of the segmented cells [7]. In particular, morphological analysis would benefit greatly from automatic segmentation in 3d and tracking across time of HSCs. This project seeks to bring these issues together and develop a segmentation technique in 4d to take a look at the morphological behaviour of HSCs in the bone marrow niche.  



This project seeks to increase our understanding of this aspect of HSC behaviour through analysis of microscopy data from mouse models. <br>
